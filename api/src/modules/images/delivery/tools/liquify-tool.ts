    'Pushes image content: what is at `from` slides to `to`, fading out smoothly over `radius`. Subtle reshaping like Photoshop Liquify, e.g. lifting the corners of a mouth into a closed smile, or slimming a shape. Keep each push small (under a third of its radius) and prefer one wide push over several narrow ones: pushes on the same spot add up, and a large total move over a small radius bends lines into hooks. Zoom in with render_image region to check. Only moves existing pixels; it cannot invent new detail.',
